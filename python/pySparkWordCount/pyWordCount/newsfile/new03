Most international centres would descend into a blind panic if their international coach decided they had spent their entire careers wearing the wrong number, but mere digits mean precious little to Manu Tuilagi. The human bowling ball finally rolled back into England training on Tuesdat after endless months of orthopaedic misery and immediately pronounced himself ready – and, indeed, able – to switch midfield positions on the say-so of the red-rose boss Eddie Jones.

Last week, Jones’ plans for the Leicester midfielder became crystal clear. “I’ll tell you what Manu isn’t, and that’s a No 13,” he said, thereby questioning the positional logic underpinning Tuilagi’s entire representative career to date. “He’s an inside centre, not an outside centre. And I think he can be a world-class inside centre.”

If this development alarmed the Samoan-born back, or even surprised him, he made a convincing job of disguising it. “I’ve had a chat with Eddie about my best position, but it’s just numbers in the end,” he said. “Inside and outside? They’re different, but they’re very similar. At the set pieces, you can switch depending on who the opposition have on the field. In phase play, it’s a matter of who gets there first.”
Tuilagi last played for England on the summer tour of New Zealand in 2014: since then, he has struggled to see off a deep-seated groin injury that, in his darker moments, made him fear for his career. “You realise how special it is, playing professional sport, when you’re not involved,” he said. “It’s not really a job, doing what you love. Sometimes, you take it for granted.
