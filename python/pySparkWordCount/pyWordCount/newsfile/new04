United’s injuries were now biting hard, with the lack of creativity on the pitch or alternative options on the bench beginning to tell as Watford maintained their grip on the game in the second-half.

Mata and Herrera both lacked the physical strength to make their quality tell against Watford’s imposing midfield and United simply could not get a foothold in the game.

Etienne Capoue gave United an early warning of Watford’s ambition by fizzing a 35-yard shot over the crossbar before defender Sebastian Prodl forced a reflex save from De Gea with a flicked header from an inswinging corner.

When Ighalo missed another good opportunity on 54 minutes, curling wide after turning Fosu-Mensah, the home crowd began to raise its voice in an attempt to inspire Van Gaal’s players.

In turn, Mata upped his game and Depay attempted to create something out wide. Rashford began to run at the Watford defence, with the youngster’s pace at least troubling the visitors’ rearguard, but clear-cut chances failed to materialise until Mata hooked a left-foot shot wide from 10 yards on 66 minutes.

Watford continued to pressure United, but Nordin Amrabat shot over from six yards before Prodl headed wide at the far post from even closer.

United rode their luck all night, but Mata’s goal was the one flash of quality and it arrived at a crucial moment.
