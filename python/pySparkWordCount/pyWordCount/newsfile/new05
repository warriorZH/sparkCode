 Mata was handed the captaincy by Van Gaal – a statement in itself which underlined the lack of senior figures available to the Dutchman. With Wayne Rooney, Chris Smalling, Carrick and Bastian Schweinsteiger all unavailable, Mata was seemingly the only option.

 But such has been the unpredictable nature of United’s season, nobody could safely predict whether Watford would be brushed aside at Old Trafford or if Flores’ team would use their experience to send the home side and their promising bunch of kids back to school.

 In the first half, at least, Watford held the upper hand, with forwards Troy Deeney and Ighalo repeatedly exposing the weaknesses at the heart of United’s defence.

 They were always going to be a handful for Blind and Fosu-Mensah and United lived on their wits at times.

 Blind did well to intercept a goal-bound Ighalo shot after 12 minutes, diverting it behind for a corner, but the Dutch international then dropped his team in it six minutes later by losing possession to the Watford striker, only to see goalkeeper David de Gea save Ighalo’s shot.

Fosu-Mensah twice produced impressive challenges beyond his years on Ighalo to deny the Nigerian a clean strike at goal, but aside from a dipping volley from Morgan Schneiderlin which bounced just wide on 19 minutes, it was all Watford.

And Ighalo spurned another good chance on 27 minutes, after being fed by Deeney’s flick, when he turned Marcos Rojo before seeing his shot run just wide of De Gea’s far post.

United, in contrast, were toothless at the other end. Marcus Rashford was starved of service and Memphis Depay spent the opening period shooting high, wide and not-so-handsome.

Anthony Martial twice found himself with a chance to beat goalkeeper Gomes, but the French forward, back in action after missing two games with a tight hamstring, shot tamely at goal.

Watford carried all the threat and another mistake by Blind gifted Ighalo another chance – once against wasted – on 42 minutes.
