It is all very well being a modern dad, but there are some things a man just cannot help with. “Without getting particularly graphic, there’s nothing much I can do,” Andy Murray said here yesterday when asked whether his three-week-old baby Sophia had been disrupting his sleep.

“She is waking up because she wants feeding and unfortunately my body doesn’t produce any milk. I can’t help too much there. In the night I would stay up with her as late as is needed, whilst Kim is asleep. In the night, Kim would get up. If I was training early the next day, my mother-in-law was staying with us as well and she was helping too.

He added: “Everyone is telling me sleep is the hardest part but we have been really lucky because she’s been sleeping really well.”
