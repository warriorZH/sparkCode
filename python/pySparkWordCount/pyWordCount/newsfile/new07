Murray is here preparing for the start of the defence of Britain’s Davis Cup title. It is also the Scot’s first competitive action since his loss to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final nearly five weeks ago.

“It’s been nice to have a few weeks at home,” Murray said, his wife Kim having given birth to their first child just six days after his return from Melbourne. “Now I’ve spent a few days away from home, which isn’t easy, but obviously I had to go back to playing at some stage.”

His wife and daughter will not be here this week, but Murray said they would be with him at next month’s Miami Masters, which might give an indication of how travelling as a family would suit them.

“Babies are pretty portable at this age,” he said. “We’ll just play it by ear a little bit and see how well that works out. It’s not really up to me. It’s up to Kim as well, how much she would like to travel, too. Kim only really comes to maybe five tournaments during the year. Maybe she would come to two or three more, but I don’t see us travelling as a family all the time.”
