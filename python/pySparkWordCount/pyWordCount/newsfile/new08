Roger Federer and his wife Mirka employ several nannies and a nursery school teacher to look after their two sets of twins, but the Murrays have no plans to bring in a nanny, despite the advice of many fellow players.

He added: “I think everyone’s said that the more effort you put in, the more rewarding it is. You get so much back out of it, so to give as much time as you can, to enjoy every minute – because, even though at the beginning it can be challenging, with sleep and whatnot, you’ll miss it when it’s not there – that it’s a nice stage to look back on, to enjoy every minute of being a parent.”

Asked what had surprised him most about becoming a father, Murray said that watching his wife’s labour had been difficult. “It’s an amazing experience but it’s also difficult to see someone you care about go through that,” he said. “It’s also how much [babies] change on a daily basis at this stage. They’re growing all of the time. Pictures from the first day to three weeks now, she looks like a completely different person.”

Murray, who confirmed the appointment of the former British player Jamie Delgado as his assistant coach, said he would play in all of Britain’s Davis Cup ties this year if fit. He said he did not know how fatherhood would affect his tennis but added: “It can only be a positive thing. I don’t see it being negative at all, in terms of my career.”

Leon Smith, Britain’s captain, will decide today on his second singles player. Kyle Edmund suffered a back problem yesterday and could be replaced by Dan Evans. The doubles specialists Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot complete the squad. Japan’s hopes rest largely on Kei Nishikori, the world No 6.
