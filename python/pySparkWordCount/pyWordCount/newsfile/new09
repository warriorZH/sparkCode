The future of competitive British basketball is in doubt because of a lack of funding despite being the second most popular team sport played by teenagers.

British basketball is arguably at its lowest ebb in a decade and currently receives just £10million in funding over four years from Sport England and nothing from UK Sport. Funding was cut in March because of a perceived poor performance at London 2012 despite the world’s premier basketball league, America’s National Basketball Association (NBA), appearing committed to growing the sport in the United Kingdom. The NBA has hosted six regular-season games in London in recent years and helps run four youth leagues in three cities.

The game remains popular among young people, with 218,000 boys and girls aged 14-16 playing basketball once a week. That makes it the second most popular team sport behind football, according to a 2014 UK Sport survey into participation, with half of those kids coming from black and minority ethnic communities.

The level of funding basketball receives stands in stark contrast to that received by more expensive, restrictive sports such as rowing (£32.6m) and sailing (£25.5m)  because of the way UK Sport divides its pot of money.

Rowing and sailing, for example, receive high funding in spite of lower participation because at the elite level British athletes are medal winners. The policy has undoubtedly improved Team GB, which climbed from an embarrassing 36th in the medal table at Atlanta 1996 to third at London 2012.
