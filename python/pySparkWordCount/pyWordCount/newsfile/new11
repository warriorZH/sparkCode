A massive volcanic eruption many thousands of times bigger than anything seen on Earth, or indeed anywhere else in the Solar System, changed the face of Mars forever at a time when life on our own planet had just begun, a study has found.

The Red Planet we see today through our telescopes and binoculars has tilted on its axis by up to 25 degrees from its original position about three billion years ago, according to a detailed study of the dry Martian valleys created by ancient volcanic activity.
