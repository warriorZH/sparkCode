Scientists have calculated that the creation of the Tharsis dome, which at 5,000km in diameter is the biggest volcanic outcrop in the Solar System, shifted the centre of gravity of the entire planet so that its surface became twisted like the “flesh of an apricot around its stone”, the researchers said.

The Martian poles also shifted by between 20 and 25 degrees, which might explain why Nasa’s Phoenix lander of 2008 detected water ice at a location that was once a polar ice cap, said Sylvain Bouley of the Université Pari-Sud, and the lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.
