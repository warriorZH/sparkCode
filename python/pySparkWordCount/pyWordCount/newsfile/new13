The Tharsis volcanic region is much bigger than anything seen on Earth. Dr Bouley estimated that it must be about 10,000 times the size of the giant volcanoes on Hawaii, a size that allowed a dramatic and permanent change in the Martian landscape.

“Mars was a very different planet to the one we are able to see today. We need to understand how its landscape has changed over time if we are to get the best out of future missions to the planet,” Dr Bouley said.

The study was based on interpreting the original positions of the valley networks on Mars, which now have an unusual distribution but were once aligned in parallel to the Martian equator before they were twisted by the changing landscape.
