The research, which includes a unique comparative study between Kelly and his earthbound identical twin brother Mark, also a former astronaut, is designed to help NASA prepare for the physical and psychological demands that will be made of the crew of a Mars mission that would last an estimated 30 months. The American space agency has set the 2030s as the target for its first manned mission to the Red Planet.

In order to make such a feat even feasible, scientists need to find ways to counter some of the effects that long-term exposure to weightlessness is known to have on astronauts, such as the upwards redistribution of fluid around the body.

The phenomenon has a number of negative effects, ranging from a puffy face to the heart having to pump a higher volume of liquid to increased pressure on the eyeball which can cause problems with vision and, in extremis, blindness. One study has found that nearly two-thirds of astronauts on long missions suffer some form of visual impairment as a result of being in space.
