Three British professors have won “the Nobel Prize of neuroscience” for discovering the secrets of how memories are formed in the brain.

The victory of Tim Bliss, Graham Collingridge and Richard Morris marks the first time that the Grete Lundbeck European Brain Research Prize – “The Brain Prize” – has had an all-British winners list.

The three researchers will share the €1m (£780,000) prize for solving a mystery that had baffled scientists for nearly 100 years.
