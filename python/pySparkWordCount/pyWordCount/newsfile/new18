“Memory is such an integral part of who we are that not having a mechanism was an affront to science,” said Professor Bliss, 75, of the Francis Crick Institute in London.

“Ever since about 1900, when it was discovered that there were junctions between nerve cells, the assumption had been that the only way for information to be stored in the brain was for the strength of the connection between nerve cells to be changed somehow. The problem was: where were these synapses [nerve connections] whose strength could be permanently changed?”

Given that the human brain consists of roughly 100 billion neurons (nerve cells), each with about 5,000 synapses, adding up to a total of something like 500 trillion synapses per brain, the search was unlikely to be straightforward.
