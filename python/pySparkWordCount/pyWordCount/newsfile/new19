Professor Bliss made the first breakthrough with his Norwegian colleague, Terje Lomo. Experimenting on rabbits, they were able to identify a set of synapses in the hippocampus – a brain region vital to memory – that could be permanently strengthened when given the right kind of electrical stimulation.

In 1973 they published the first descriptions of what became known as long-term potentiation (LTP), the process underpinning the brain’s inherent “plasticity” – its ability to reorganise itself in response to experience.

Professor Collingridge, 61, who spent most of his career at Bristol University, then found NMDA receptors, the proteins that had to be activated to start the process of LTP.

Finally, Professor Morris proved the importance of LTP to animals’ ability to learn and remember. By treating rats with a special drug that blocked the normal LTP process, he showed that without LTP animals were incapable of learning to navigate their way round a maze.
