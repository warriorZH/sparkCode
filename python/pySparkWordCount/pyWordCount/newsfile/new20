Professor Morris, 67, of Edinburgh University, said that although the trio’s work could not prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease, it might lead to the creation of drugs that could alleviate memory loss during the very early stages of the illness.

“We now have sufficient understanding to look very seriously at ways in which we might be able to improve memory or alleviate some of the memory problems that happen in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases,” he said.

Although the three never conducted experiments together, Professor Bliss said winning the prize was “particularly pleasing, not only because it recognises the strength of UK neuroscience, but also because I am sharing it with two old friends”. Asked how he would spend his prize money, he said: “I think I am going to buy an electric car with some of it – as for the rest, I haven’t the slightest idea.”
