Employees prefer a consistently unfair boss to an erratic line manager, a new study found.

Researchers from Michigan State University(MSU) found a manager who easily changes from courteous to rude is more stressful than an unswervingly bad boss.

The study, published in the Academy of Management Journal, involved a laboratory experiment measuring the stress levels of 160 students.

A third of those students were treated fairly, a third unfairly and a third erratically - from fair to unfair.
