The researchers also conducted a field study of 95 employers in a variety of industries - the results from which supported the lab experiment results regarding worker-manager relations.

Lead author Fadel Matta, from the MSU Broad College of Business, said: "Our findings essentially show that employees are better off if their boss is a consistent jerk rather than being a loose cannon who's fair at times and unfair at other times.

"We found that inconsistent treatment is much more stressful than being treated poorly all the time."

Co-author, Professor Brett Scott concluded that people valued consistency and predicability in treatment as much as whether the treatment itself was fair.
