He added: "Let's not lose sight of the fact that the best outcomes for employees occurred when their supervisors were consistently fair

"However, if supervisors are going to be unfair, the results suggest that they would be better off behaving that way all of the time.

"Prioritising self-discipline, focus and careful thinking could help deliver leaders who are not just fair some of the time, but who are instead fair almost all of the time."
