Earlier this week, the property agent JLL warned that there is a diminishing appetite for properties costing £2m and over in new-build developments. And the investment bank Morgan Stanley has forecast the price of new upmarket London flats to fall by as much as 20 per cent this year.

Riaan Kruger is the head of sales and lettings at Garton Jones. He is selling a £2.3m three-bed flat at One Nine Elms, where residents will have access to a gym, swimming pool and 24-hour concierge service. Mr Kruger says there is “no disputing” there has been a slowdown in demand for properties over the £2m range. But he believes there is still a large potential buyer market.

“The same pool of buyers still exists, yet there is now just so much more property for them to choose from,” he explains. “Nine Elms alone has over 20 developments on offer and thus competition for buyers has increased.”

But not all real estate experts agree that there is a queue of buyers. Trevor Abrahmsohn, the managing director of Glentree International, says a raft of overseas buyers have been deterred from snapping up homes owing to new UK tax burdens.

In November last year George Osborne shocked the property market by announcing a new 3 per cent additional stamp duty rate from this April on property bought as a second home or buy-to-let.

Before that the Chancellor had also increased stamp duty on properties in excess of £1.5m to 12 per cent. Mr Abrahmsohn says this has made the market “more circumspect and considered”.
