Two years ago Sir Elton John sang “I’m still standing” beneath the chimneys of Battersea Power Station. The rock star had been invited to perform at a lavish party to celebrate the redevelopment of the historic building into luxury flats.

The London property market was booming. International investors viewed London property – in particular its luxury flats – as an ideal place to shelter money from political and economic turmoil. Plus London prices always seemed to be rising. Mark Collins of the property agent CBRE summed up the attraction by citing “the robust economy, low interest rates, world class education and favourable exchange rates”.

But is the party over? Is the market “still standing”? According to London Residential Research, sales are falling in some of the most affluent areas: sales of new-build flats in Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster were down 47 per cent in 2015.
