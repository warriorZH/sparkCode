He adds that he has heard of a number of buyers from Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and China “walking away” even if they have exchanged contracts and paid a deposit. “They would rather lose 10 per cent than complete the purchase and lose a lot more, even before the developments are complete. The changes to buy-to-let tax is the straw that broke the camel’s back and some developers are nursing a massive over-supply of these properties.”

In recent years luxury developments would often be showcased in Singapore, China and Malaysia. But this is now grinding to a halt, says Mr Abrahmsohn. “The capital is no longer perceived as a safe haven for property investments and we have lost this inflow of foreign capital.”

Research compiled for The Independent by CBRE and Molior London, shows that last year more than 60,000 new homes were under construction in the capital, of which more than half were bought off-plan, many by wealthy foreigners. But while the new data shows that 64 per cent of the homes in 2015 were bought-off plan, it also reveals this has slowed from 67 per cent in the previous year (see graph).

Other factors that seem to be spooking would-be-buyers, including British ones, are political uncertainty ahead of a London mayoral election in May and the European Union referendum in June.

However, a handful of companies insist it is largely business as usual, albeit at a slower pace. Killian Hurley, the chief executive of housebuilder Mount Anvil says his firm sold 17 homes costing £1m or more in the first two months of 2016, up from 11 in the same period last year. A spokesman for Battersea Power Station says nearly all of 1,500 new homes in the first wave of the redevelopment have been presold.
