Walter Mythen of the agent Johns&Co, also points out that there could be confusion about how many luxury properties are currently on the market: “Often vendors use multiple agencies… so it can look as if there are many more properties for sale than is the reality,” he says.

But the optimists seem to be in a minority. The FTSE 250 developer Capital & Counties said last week that a “challenging” property market has brought sales of new apartments at its Earls Court development, to a virtual halt. And the trade magazine Property Week has reported that FTSE 100 giant British Land is struggling to sell luxury homes in central London.

The London market is certainly not a party for everyone in attendance, and a number of developers might feel Sir Elton’s lyric “it’s a sad, sad situation” reflects the current market mood. It certainly is for those who gambled that London’s luxury house prices would keep shooting to the sky.
