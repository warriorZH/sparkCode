Jeremy Corbyn has accused the Prime Minister of being in “denial” about a shortage of teachers in British schools.

The Labour leader said recruitment and retention problems were damaging children’s education – but also costing £1.3 billion a year as staff on expensive agency contracts were drafted in.

“The problem is that classes sizes are growing and there’s a crisis of teacher shortages as well,” he said at Prime Minister’s Questions.
