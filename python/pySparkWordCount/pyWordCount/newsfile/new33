“I’ve been talking to many teachers … with increasing numbers of teachers leaving the profession will the Government now accept that there is now a crisis of recruitment and of retention in this profession?

David Cameron replied by criticising Scottish Labour’s proposal to put a penny on the basic rate of income tax.

“There are 13,000 more teachers in our schools than when I became prime minister. If he worries about teacher recruitment, perhaps he can explain this. How is it going to help – his party’s proposal to put up the basic rate of tax, starting in Scotland?” he said.

“I don’t think recruiting teachers is simply about money, it’s also about having a good school system, but it certainly won’t help if we listen to Labour and put up people’s taxes.”

Mr Corbyn replied:  “He seems to be in a bit of denial here. Ofsted and the NAO all confirm there is a shortage and a crisis of teachers. Ensuring there are enough excellent teachers in our schools is obviously fundamental to the life chances of children.

“70 per cent of head teachers warned they’re now having to use agency staff to staff their classrooms – isn’t it time the Governemnt intervened and looked at the real cost of this: damage to children’s education but also £1.3 billion spend last year on agency teachers?”
