Campaigners for Britain to stay in the EU must stand up to anti-immigration rhetoric and not shy away from celebrating “the wonderful gift” of freedom of movement, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas will urge.

In a call for the pro-EU camp to make a more positive case for staying in the union, Ms Lucas will urge fellow progressives to stand up for EU nationals’ right to live and work in the UK, and to champion the benefits of freedom of movement to British students, workers and retirees.

Speaking at the London School of Economics (LSE) on 3 March, Ms Lucas is expected to say: “No case for the EU is complete without making clear just how much we value the contributions of our fellow Europeans to our country. They are our doctors, our nurses, our shopkeepers, our plumbers, our teachers, our professors, our builders.
