David Cameron’s EU renegotiation sought to address public concerns about immigration by achieving new restrictions on welfare payments for EU migrants. Meanwhile, the migrant and refugee crisis on the Continent has led pro-EU campaigners to shy away from citing freedom of movement as one of the benefits of EU membership.

By contrast, Leave campaigners, particularly the Leave.EU campaign, spearheaded by the millionaire UKIP donor Arron Banks, have highlighted greater border control as one of the major benefits of leaving the EU.

Ms Lucas will argue that freedom of movement had not always functioned “smoothly”, leading to strains on local services and community cohesion in areas of high immigration, and echoed calls from the Labour party for extra Government support to those areas most-affected.

But she will emphasise that it has benefitted not only the UK economy, through the tax receipts of EU nationals living and working in the country, but the lives of millions of British nationals who can live, study and work abroad.
