“We don’t have a large number of officials in the business department who are negotiating trade deals at the moment,” he said. “We’d need to divert huge government resources to, I presume, trying to negotiate simultaneously 50 deals. That would be a massive undertaking.”

Rachel Reeves, a Labour member of the Treasury Select Committee, said that jobs and investment would “inevitably be at risk if we were to leave the EU.”

But eurosceptic ministers have dismissed Government warnings about the fallout of Brexit for Britain’s trade deals. Leader of the House of Commons Chris Grayling said it would be “imperative” for countries like France and Germany to reach favourable terms with the UK because “their industries, their car industries in Germany, their agricultural industries in France, depend on our consumers”.
On 2 March, the leaders of the Remain campaign group, Britain Stronger in Europe, restated the economic risks to the UK of leaving the EU, pointing out that trade deals would need to be renegotiated, not only with the EU, but with up to 50 other countries with whom our current arrangements have been negotiated via the EU.

Appearing before the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe, told MPs that trade renegotiations in the event of Brexit would take “many, many years” and require “huge government resources”.
