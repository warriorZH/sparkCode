Ministers are under strong pressure to water down plans to deprive the Labour Party of millions of pounds of funding it receives from trade unionists.

A majority on a cross-party House of Lords committee recommended a wide-ranging review of the way all political parties are funded before the Government implements its plan to force union members who currently pay the political levy to “opt in” to the payments.

The peers called for the transition period for an “opt-in” system for new union members  to be extended from three to 12 months, which would limit the damage to Labour’s finances. They said trade unionists should not have to renew their decision to “opt in” every five years, as the Trade Union Bill proposes.
