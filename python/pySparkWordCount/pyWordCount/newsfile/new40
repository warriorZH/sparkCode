The report released on 2 March could force the Government to make concessions because it does not enjoy a majority in the Lords. Its proposal has been attacked as a “partisan” attempt to cripple Labour by Liberal Democrat and Labour peers.

A Downing Street spokesman said: “We will look at the detail of the report, but we set out clearly in our manifesto the proposals [on the political levy] which we want to introduce. It is a system that is already operating in Northern Ireland.” The manifesto also promised to “seek agreement on a comprehensive package of party funding reform” but there is no sign of talks.

Lords Burns, the independent peer who chaired the committee, said: “All members strongly backed the call for the Government to convene cross-party talks  as soon as possible, in order to reach a fair and long-lasting settlement to the vexed issue of party funding.”
