Ministers have decided not to introduce monetary charges for freedom of information requests, following a review of the policy.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, introduced in 2000, any private citizen can request any information held by a public body, subject to certain restrictions.

FOI is regularly used by campaigners and the media to scrutinise the Government’s activities, at both a local and national level.
Officials and ministers have however complained that the extra scrutiny the Act provides does not give them a “safe space” to discuss things without the public knowing about it.

Tony Blair has said he regrets introducing the law, describing himself as a “naive, foolish, irresponsible nincompoop”.

The Government set up a Freedom of Information Commission last year to look at the policy and how it might be changed.

One of the ways proposed to water down the transparency rules was to introduce fees – however this has now been rejected.
