“After 10 years, we took the decision to review the Freedom of Information Act and we have found it is working well,” Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock said.

“We will not make any legal changes to FOI. We will spread transparency throughout public services, making sure all public bodies routinely publish details of senior pay and perks.

The Government – which has a slim majority and could face defeat over any controversial proposals – says it will not legislate to change the Act.

In September newspapers including the Independent, Guardian, the Daily Mail, Metro, Evening Standard, the Sun, Times, Telegraph and Mirror group, signed a joint letter addressed to the Prime Minister asking him not to water down the law.

Britain’s top civil servant, the Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, also said he opposed significant changes to the Act’s powers and instead favoured clarification.
