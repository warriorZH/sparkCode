One of the many, many upsets of the remastered Star Wars films was that Han Solo no longer shot first.

In the first film, later retitled Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, the loveable rogue enters into discussion with Greedo. Things heat up quickly and the two exchange gun fire, with the green Alien ending up dead on the table.

The catch, though, was that in the original version Solo appeared to shoot first, making him a cold-blooded killer, yet in the remaster Greedo shot first, meaning that Harrison Ford’s character only shot to save his own life.

Whether #HanShotFirst has been argued tirelessly between fans, with many believing George Lucas should have never changed the firefight as it affects our perception of Solo too drastically.

Now, thanks to Chewbacca himself - Peter Mayhew - we have seen the original script, titled The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the “Journal of the Whills”, and it confirms Solo shot first.
