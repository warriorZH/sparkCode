Nina, the long-awaited and controversial Nina Simone biopic, is finally here.

The film, starring Zoe Saldana as Simone, has experience criticism and production problems for more than two decades.

Simone Kelly, Nina’s daughter, was previously outspoken objecting to the project. In a public statement, Simone called the film “unauthorized” and said “The Nina Simone Estate was never asked permission nor invited to participate.”
Hip-Hop diva Mary J Blige was originally set to star in the film before ultimately dropping out due to scheduling conflicts. When director Cynthia Mort chose Afro-Latino actress Zoe Saldana as her replacement, outcry began to pour in.

Simone would eventually help produce Netflix’s Oscar-nominated documentary, What Happened, Miss Simone? released last year.

Nina will hit theaters on April 22.
