Ignition' and 'Ignition (Remix)': two tracks with which R. Kelly dared to challenge the very definition of what a remix constitutes.

Though both appear side-by-side on his 2003 release, Chocolate Factory; 'Ignition (Remix)' is a remix of 'Ignition' only so far as it features a couple of the same backbeats and strong revisit to the word, "bounce".

The story goes that 'Ignition', first recorded in 2002, was originally set to appear on Kelly's Loveland album. After its leak, and Kelly's decision to turn Loveland into Chocolate Factory, 'Ignition' received its remix after the studio liked the "bounce, bounce" ending to the song.
