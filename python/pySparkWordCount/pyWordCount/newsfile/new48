However, the story doesn't end there. Whilst in conversation with Kelly, GQ uncovered what they described as the "bizarre and counter-logical" origins to the hit 'Ignition (Remix)'.

Apparently, Kelly wrote the main basis of 'Ignition (Remix)', specifically the lyrics "It's the remix to 'Ignition'/ hot and fresh out the kitchen", a whole five or so years before he wrote 'Ignition'. The lines were temporarily shelved, as Kelly didn't particularly think they were any good; potentially because "remix to 'Ignition'" was an entirely meaningless phrase at that point.

To break that little factoid down: R. Kelly wrote lyrics identifying the remix to a song which would not exist on this planet for another five years.

Though he admits it's "ass-backwards", when asked how exactly he managed to write remixed lyrics to a song he hadn't created yet, all he could do was say, "You tell me."
