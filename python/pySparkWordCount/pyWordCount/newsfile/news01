Juan Mata hauled Manchester United back into the Champions League reckoning with a stunning free-kick to seal victory in a game which should have resulted in Watford’s first victory at Old Trafford.

Mata, captain due to the mounting injury crisis at the club, had struggled to make an impact in the game as Odion Ighalo missed a series of chances to win the game for Quique Sanchez Flores’ team.

But after Anthony Martial had been fouled on the edge of the penalty area by Miguel Britos in the 83rd minute, Mata curled a pinpoint free-kick over the wall and beyond the grasp of goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes to claim all three points and move United level with Manchester City, who have a game in hand, in fourth place.

And following a season of frustration at Old Trafford, a late surge into the top four could yet extend Louis van Gaal’s stay at the club beyond this summer and into the final year of his contract.

Despite the thrilling manner of United’s 3-2 victory against Arsenal at the weekend, the youth and inexperience of Van Gaal’s team was always going to ensure that a bump in the road would have to be negotiated at some point.

With Michael Carrick ruled out through injury, 18-year-old defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah was handed his first senior start, alongside Daley Blind at centre-half, to reduce the average age of United’s starting 11 to just over 23 years.
